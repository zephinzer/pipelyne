# Pipelyne
A theoretical experiment to enable writing a CI/CD pipeline in good ol' JavaScript.

> "Atwood would be proud"

## Benefits

1. Run your pipeline locally
2. Involve developers by using their favourite language
3. Run JavaScript instead of Bash
4. Distribute your pipeline 
5. Write once, export for multiple CI runners

## Scope

- [x] Consumer able to define pipeline stages via `.stage()` ([see usage](#defining-a-stage))
- [x] Consumer able to define pipeline jobs within a stage via `.job()` ([see usage](#defining-a-job))
- [x] Consumer able to add manually input bash scripts via `.run()` ([see usage](#defining-a-shell-command))
- [x] Consumer able to load a Pipelyne by specifying a file path URI ([see usage](#loading-external-pipelyne-via-path))
- [x] Consumer able to load a an externally defined Pipelyne ([see usage](#loading-external-pipelyne))
- [ ] Consumer able to do file manipulation
- [ ] Consumer able to set file ownership permissions
- [ ] Consumer able to set file modification/execution permissions
- [ ] Consumer able to run NPM scripts from `package.json`
- [ ] Consumer able to publish to NPM
- [ ] Consumer able to publish to DockerHub
- [ ] Consumer able to do a Git push to repository
- [ ] Consumer able to export pipeline to GitLab format
- [x] Consumer able to export pipeline to Travis format ([see usage](#exporting-pipelyne-for-travis))

## Installation

```bash
# with npm < 5
npm i pipelyne --save;
# or with npm > 5
npm i pipelyne;
# or with yarn
yarn add pipelyne
```

## Usage

### Importing & Initialisation

```js
import {Pipelyne} from 'pipelyne';

const pipeline = new Pipelyne();
```

### Defining a Stage

```js
pipeline.stage('stage name', {/* stage options */})
```

### Defining a Job

```js
pipeline
  .stage('stage name', {/* stage options */})
  .job('job name', {/* job options */})
```

### Defining a Shell Command

```js
pipeline
  .stage('stage name', {/* stage options */})
  .job('job name', {/* job options */})
  .run('pwd') // runs the `pwd` command
```

### Loading external Pipelyne via path

```js
pipeline.load('./path/to/pipelyne.js');
```

> **NOTE**: The file at `./path/to/pipelyne.js` should export a `pipelyne` property.

### Loading external Pipelyne

```js
pipeline.load(require('./path/to/pipelyne.js').pipelyne);
```

> **NOTE**: The loaded pipelyne should be an instance of Pipelyne.

### Exporting Pipelyne for Travis

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
// ...
// export the pipeline into a file named .travis.yml
fs.writeFileSync(
  path.join(__dirname, './.travis.yml'),
  pipeline.exportFor('travis')
);
```

## API

### `Pipelyne` Instance

A Pipelyne instance exposes the following methods:

| Method | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.stage` | `:stageName`, `:stageOptions` | Defines a stage named `:stageName`. See [StageOptions](#stageoptions) for possible configurations |
| `.job` | `:jobName`, `:jobOptions` | Defines a job named `:jobName` under the current stage. See [JobOptions](#joboptions) for possible configurations |
| `.run` | `:script`, `:commandOptions` | Defines a command that runs a shell script containing the script `:script`. See [CommandOptions](#commandoptions) for possible configurations |
| `.load` | `:pathToPipelyne` OR `:Pipelyne` | Loads an externally defined Pipelyne. When the parameter is a String, the String is taken as the relative path URI to a file exporting a property `"pipelyne"` which should be a `Pipelyne` instance. When the parameter is a Pipelyne, the defined stages are automatically loaded into the current Pipelyne. |
| `.toString` | `:format` | Exports the current Pipelyne as a String. See [PipelyneStringFormat](#pipelynestringformat) for possible formats. |
| `.exportFor` | `:ciProvider` | Exports the current Pipelyne in the format of the specified `:ciProvider`. Currently only Travis is supported. See [our pipelyne.js](./pipelyne.js) for an example of doing this. The `pipelyne.js` is executed using the NPM script `pipeline`. [See the package.json](./package.json) |

## Configuration

### `RunnableOptions`

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowFailure` | Boolean | Decides whether the Runnable is allowed to fail. |
| `id` | String | Indiciates the ID of the Runnable. This should be automatically generated by the Runnable's constructor. |

### `StageOptions`
Stage options includes all the configurations in [`RunnableOptions`](#runnableoptions) as well as the following:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | String | Name in normal text. The `id` of the Stage will be set to a `kebab-case`d version of the name. |

### `JobOptions`
Job options includes all the configurations in [`RunnableOptions`](#runnableoptions) as well as the following:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | String | Name in normal text. The `id` of the Job will be set to a `kebab-case`d version of the name. |

### `CommandOptions`
Command options includes all the configurations in [`RunnableOptions`](#runnableoptions).

No extra configurations are available.

### `PipelyneStringFormat`
This can be one of `"json"` or `"overview"`.
